String variables containing paths
Progresive probability of finding certain stuff
terrain extender beyond limits (big numbers)
gui bar for shininess & specularStrength
Function for normals generation (and more encapsulations?)

LOD > Endless terrain (pixel circle) > Threading > Change resolution depending on distance from the viewer >
> not updating chunks in every frame (make the viewer move some distance before doing it (viewerMoveThresholdForChunckUpdate)) (remember that getting the square distance is faster than actual distance)

Pixel area (border's normals) (different LOD areas joints)

Bug:   terrainGenerator terrX = (worldChunks.chunkDict[k]);     // double free or corruption (!prev)
Class encapsulation of OpenGL functions
ImGui
Light cast
Compute MVP matrices only once
Pass parameters to the shader as uniforms (instead of hard-coding them in the shader)
Single VAO for all chuncks
BENCHMARK terrain generation (single VAO Vs multiple VAO)

terrainChunks:
        (X) Fog
        ( ) Don't show non-visible chunks
        ( ) Low level of detail far away
	( ) When fixing borders normals, don't compute noise again if it can be taken from the chunk next to it
	(X) Rounded area
	(X) Follow the camera
	(X) Don't send again to GPU already sent chunks
	(X) Hay acumulaciÃ³n de chunks creciente al avanzar?? No lo es
	(X) Encapsular terrain rendering
	(X) Ommit first terrain creation

I modified the glfw library:
glfw3.h   ->   I modified line 210. Instead of:
   #include <GL/gl.h>
I put:
  #if !defined(GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN)	// ans
   #include <GL/gl.h>
  #endif							// ans

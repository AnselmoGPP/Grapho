Not required:
	
	Spherical chunks borders (for texture scaling) are not perfect (acceptable bug)

BUGS:
	Sometimes camera continue moving backwards/left indefinetely.
	Camera jump when starting to move camera.
	When escaping too soon (before planet is rendered), exception happens (elements not already destroyed when calling cleanup)
	Bug? In updateStates: render() & set UBOs > move models > Copy UBOs to GPU. Problem: UBOs must be set immediatly after render() because, if it's rendered too fast, the model could be rendered before moving models.
	When ESC pressed, a bug arises if modelsToLoad has still models when closing
	Fragment shader (f_planet.frag): Artifact lines
	Check whether the Y axis in normal maps is correctly fipped upside down (Vulkan maps Y axis inversely than OGL)
	Check that normal maps are correctly put in each face of the planet during Triplanar mapping (I suspect they may not be)
	BUG: PRESS ESCAPE JUST BEFORE RENDERING
	Bug when resizing window (crashes) (and maybe not everything is loaded yet) (Out-of-date/Suboptimal KHR or window resized)
	Make terrain too big makes chunks not to update (maybe because chunk's center is too far)

----------------------------------------

	- Axis
	- Sun billboard (transparencies)
	- Terrain
	> Modify NoiseSurface for it to have some state (noiseSet...) and generate buffers outside itself
	Make the renderer a static library
	Add ProcessInput() maybe
	Dynamic states (graphics pipeline)
	Push constants
	Deferred rendering (https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/forward-rendering-vs-deferred-rendering--gamedev-12342)

	UBO of each renders should be stored in a vector-like structure, so there are UBO available for new renders (generated with setRender())
	Destroy Vulkan buffers (UBO) outside semaphores

	TerrainGrid:
	>Planet version
	exception when going too far -> try your own octaves implementation
	Destructor TerrainGrid/Chunks that correctly deletes chunks
	Recicle chunks
	>Remove some non-visible chunks when there are too much of them (saves memory)
	>computeTerrain may cause bottleneck (no second thread loading)

	SphericalChunk:
	>Improve biplanar texture (shader) (and make normals/tangents correctly: Trilinear normal mapping (tangents))
	>Bug when closing rendered
	Add atmosphere
	Get textures
	Try different scenarios

	-Bug (objects not destroyed): Looks like modelsToDelete still has objects
	GUI
	Reescalation of textures with distance
	Omit VertexType, VertexPT, and similar things
	Take UV coords out from terrain data
	Create multiple "Renderer::models", one for each layer
	Rotate skybox (with the sun)
	-Fix specular lightning (if wrong) (it illuminates ground before sunrise)
	-Move Light to vertex shader

Rendering:
	- Vertex struct has pos, color, text coord. Different vertex structs are required.
	- Points, lines, triangles
	- 2D graphics
	- Transparencies
	- Scene plane: Draw in front of some rendering (used for skybox or weapons)
	Make classes more secure (hide sensitive variables)
	Parallel loading with many threads.
	When passing vertex data directly, should I copy it or pass by reference? Ok, a ref is passed to Renderer, which passes a ref to modelData, which copies data in a vector, and later in a VkBuffer. Could we avoid the copy in a vector?
	> Many renders: Now, UBO is passed many times, so View and Projection matrix are redundant. 
	> update(): Projection matrix should be updated only when it has changed
	> Generalize loadModel() (VertexPCT, etc.) 
	> Can uniforms be destroyed within the UBO class whithout making user responsible for destroying before creating 
	> Check that different operations work (add/remove renders, add/erase model, 0 renders, ... do it with different primitives)
	X VkDrawIndex instanceCount -> check this way of multiple renderings

	- Allow to update MM immediately after addModel() or addRender()
	- Only dynamic UBOs
	- Start thread since run() (objectAlreadyConstructed)
	- Improve modelData object destruction (call stuff from destructor, and take code out from Renderer)
	Can we take stuff out from thread 2?
	Optimization: Parallel commandBuffer creation (2 or more commandBuffers exist)
	model&commandBuffer mutex, think about it
	Usar numMM o MM.size()?
	Profiling
	Skybox borders (could be fixed with VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRRORED_REPEAT)

Useless/Complicated:
	Pass material to Fragment Shader
	Skybox shouldn't require transformation matrices? Just rotating
	TerrainGrid: Use int instead of floats for map key?
	TerrainGrid: Update CB only if new chuncks are required (not only when camera doesn't move)

Abstract:
	> Textures set (share textures)
	> Descriptor set

Model & Data system:
	Each ModelData could have: Vertices, Color buffers, textures, texture coords, Indices, UBO class, shaders, vertex struct
	Unique elements (always): Vertices, indices, shaders
	Unique elements (sometimes): Color buffer, texture coords,
	Shared elements (sometimes): UBO class, Textures, vertex struct(Vertices, color, textCoords)

        ( ) Low level of detail far away
	( ) When fixing borders normals, don't compute noise again if it can be taken from the chunk next to it
	(X) Rounded area
	(X) Follow the camera
	(X) Don't send again to GPU already sent chunks
	(X) Hay acumulación de chunks creciente al avanzar?? No lo es
	(X) Encapsular terrain rendering
	(X) Ommit first terrain creation

--- Issues ------------------
Vertex data (vertex, color, texture coords, indices) passed directly to a ModelData object. Problem:
If such data is passed by reference, the user has to wait until the data is loaded after fullConstructor().
If it is passed by value, user don't have to worry.

Constructor sets flag dataFromFile and fullyConstructed
fullConstruction uses dataFromFile
User uses fullyConstructed for knowing how long ModelData needs the data visible 
Alternatively, dont include fullyConstructed, but copy data directly

--- Visual code ------------------
Doesn't detect macros declared in CMakeLists.txt
Doesn't have key combination for "save all"
